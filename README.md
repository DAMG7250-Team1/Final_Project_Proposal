# SkillMatch AI â€“ Smart Resume &amp; GitHub-based Job Matchmaker


# 1. Project Abstract
SkillMatch AI is a personalized job recommendation system leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multi-Agent Systems, and the Model Completion Protocol (MCP) to match candidates to the most relevant job roles. Users upload their resume (PDF) and GitHub profile URL. The system parses the resume, analyzes GitHub projects using a dedicated agent, and intelligently recommends job opportunities. Additional agents enhance the resume and generate customized cover letters. The project utilizes both structured (job listings, skill taxonomies) and unstructured data (resumes, GitHub content), orchestrated with Airflow, deployed via FastAPI, and tested thoroughly.
